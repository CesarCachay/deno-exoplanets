This is my first project using deno which allows to read a csv file.

We use the flag --allow-read because Deno is really focusing in security and permissions.

To run the project you have 2 options:

1. The first one gives you the information of potential earths you need to write:
- deno run --allow-read mod.ts

2. The second one gives you the information of the maximum and minimum orbital period you need to write:
- deno run --allow-read periods.ts
